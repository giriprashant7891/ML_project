# ML_project
Lets use Python 3 for this project because Xichen seems to like it :P

In order to run the code, first run find_best_city_data.py with while specifying the correct file locations in the code. Once that it is done, it will create 3 data files in the current directory with the data of the best city. Then run plot_data.py to plot information about this city.
